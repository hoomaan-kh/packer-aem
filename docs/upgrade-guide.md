* Add new `aem.jdk.*` configuration properties
* Add new `aem.dispatcher.ssl_version` configuration property

### To 4.0.0

* Re-add `aws.aem_certs_base` configuration property and it's only needed when S3 bucket is used to store the TLS certificate private key
* Move AEM license from S3 to AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store as secure string, specify the parameter name in `aws.aem_license` configuration property
